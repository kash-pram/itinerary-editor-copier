# itinerary-copier-editor

This project is a client-side, browser-based content editor and formatter designed for creating structured, shareable text.

At its core, it functions as a lightweight Progressive Web App (PWA) that allows users to input, organize, and edit information within a template-driven interface. 
Its generalized functionalities include:
- **Offline Data Persistence**: Uses local browser storage to automatically save user input, ensuring data is retained even if the page is refreshed or accessed offline.
- **Template Customization**: Provides tools to start with pre-set data, reset to defaults, or clear all fields to begin a fresh entry.
- **Platform-Specific Formatting**: Features a "Smart Copy" engine that filters out empty fields and formats the remaining content with specific markdown (such as bolding and spacing) optimized for instant messaging platforms like WhatsApp.
- **Dynamic UI/UX**: Includes utility features such as a theme toggler (Dark/Light mode), a quick "Scroll-to-Top" function, and a responsive menu for managing the workspace.

In essence, it serves as a mobile-friendly utility tool for converting raw form data into neatly formatted text for easy distribution and personal record-keeping.
